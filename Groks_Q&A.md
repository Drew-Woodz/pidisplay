[Q] - Post-Manual Behavior: After manual run starts the slideshow, does systemctl status pidisplay still show active (exited), or does it change? What if you stop the service—does the manual fbi persist?

```
(venv) pi@pidisplay:~/pidisplay $ systemctl status pidisplay

The screen is now stuck on the BTC card, the last card up when I killed it.



[Q] - Error Visibility: In manual mode, does fbi print anything else besides the font message (e.g., on playlist load)? Any /var/log/messages or dmesg entries around boot related to fb1/tty1?

[A] -  I don't see any, but I'm also not sure where to look.

[Q] - Capability Check: Run getcap /usr/bin/fbi—anything? (Though AmbientCapabilities applies to the service process.)

[A] - ummm. I dunno:
      pi@pidisplay:~ $ getcap /usr/bin/fbi
      pi@pidisplay:~ $ source ~/venv/bin/activate
      (venv) pi@pidisplay:~ $ /home/pi/pidisplay/run_slideshow.sh
      using "Noto Sans Mono-16", pixelsize=16.67 file=/usr/share/fonts/truetype/noto/NotoSansMono-Regular.ttf
      (venv) pi@pidisplay:~ $ getcap /usr/bin/fbi
      (venv) pi@pidisplay:~ $


[Q] - VT State: Before manual run, what's fgconsole (current VT)? After boot blank, can you chvt 1 manually and see console?

[A] - you are overestimating my natural ability with the command line. Y'all LLMs are destroying my ability to remember commands.

[Q] - Path Forward Preference: Does GPT's fix feel aligned with your security goals (still pi-user), or would you rather explore direct blits to skip fbi quirks?

[A] - well, I guess that depends. I want the professional approach that will make this a project others might download from git in order to demonstraight how one ought to do it. The project is much more than making a neat little cycling info screen. I'm very interested in a final product that works as well and is as neatly done as something much more professional. The whole point is to present this as evidence that I know how to develop something from the ground up. on external hardware, like this pizero and the screen. I'm also down to hand a few of these out as presents to people like my parents, who could never hope to ssh in or troublshoot this. So it needs to work the first time, and keep working even when I go home and leave them a continent away.

So the question REALLY is, What do you feel about GPT's fix? I'm not a big fan of work arounds. I prefer to identify a path forward, plan it, then execute. If there are unforseen road blocks, well I'm down to do a little forcing or work arounding, but honestly if the way we intended isn't working, I feel like forcing it is how we get weak ass code that doesn't act reliably. Which results in unstable systems that I can't brag about. Stability and function are key. if it's not stable, then what's the point. I'm intersted in the best path forward, one that doesn't require jerry rigging or back flips to make work. We need a plan, and a strong understanding so that our plan works. If it doesn't, then back to the drawing board, not change this and that till it magically works. Would seem to me, that if the plan isn't possible as planned, then trying to make it work any tangential way we can isn't going to be as effective as understanding and doing it right the first time. Like, if the whole plan was the jerry rigging, then I could get behind that, but it's not, it's THIS will make it work, oh... well maybe this. no.

Best approach, stable approach.
